# MSA_2020_WeatherApp
This Web application was made for the submission of Phase 1 in the MSA program in 2020.


## Description
This Web application inform the user of the weather forecast in different cities. This is done by promting the user to input the city name into the search bar and press 'enter' or click the 'search' button. The weather data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and a short description corresponding to the result of the search will appear. 

**The app was made using the React library in the Typescript language as well as Redux.** 
The reason why i used Redux instead of React Context API is because Redux is a great tool to help me manage my states.
Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree which can't be changed directly. Although the trade-offs of using Redux for this simple Web application is not greatly benefitial, i chose to implement it as a learning experience as it is much more useful in larger scale applications.
